This project titled "Analysis of Cryptocurrency Market Financial Risk Management using Machine Learning" focuses on addressing the risks posed by the rapid growth of cryptocurrency, particularly in relation to money laundering. Financial institutions and anti-money laundering agencies face significant challenges in managing these risks due to the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions. This project applies Hierarchical Risk Parity and unsupervised machine learning to improve risk management practices, providing effective solutions for monitoring and mitigating financial risks within the cryptocurrency framework.
